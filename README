#kepler_to_cartesian

Simulation that calculates the position in three-dimensional Cartesian coordinates of a celestial body over time given the keplerian orbital elements

Each line of the input file is formatted as follows (each line rappresents a body):
time i a e inc Omega w Theta E M

Where:

time: time (years)
i: index
a: semi major axis (AU)
e: eccentricity
inc: inclination (radians)
Omega: longitude of the ascending node (radians)
w: argument of periapsis (radians)
Theta: true anomaly (radians)
E: eccentric anomaly (radians)
M: mean anomaly (radians)

True anomaly and eccentric_anomaly are skipped in the file deserialization which is why you can simply leave them as 0,
however if you need them you can add them by un-commenting the line that deserialize's the value (and you have comment a word.next())

The following formulization was followed
